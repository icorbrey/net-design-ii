**EACH QUESTION IS 10 POINTS**

- Creating a static route (`ip route [destination] [subnet-mask] [next-hop]`)
- When are Layer 2 headers rewritten (on hop)
- `shutdown` -> error-disabled if MAC address mismatch
- Fix error-disabled -> shutdown, no shutdown
- restrict -> port is up, no frames allowed
- protect -> no frames allowed if MAC address mismatch
- When enabling port security -> `switchport port-security`
- Vlans -> management, data, native, voice (kinda)
- Management VLAN -> remote management
- Native VLAN -> pass untagged traffic
- Data VLAN -> pass tagged traffic
- Trunk -> all traffic (by default)
- Standard Vlans -> 1-1000
- Legacy Vlans -> 1001-1005
- Extended Vlans -> 1006-4094
- Vlans stored in vlan.dat on flash
- Router on a stick -> trunk interface must be trunk
